Public Issue Reporting System is a web application that allows users to report and track public issues such as waste management, hazardous conditions, and infrastructure problems. Authorities can view, manage, and resolve reported issues efficiently.

The application includes features like issue reporting with descriptions and images, real-time status tracking, and an admin panel for authorities to manage reports. It also has a secure authentication system to ensure data integrity.

The frontend is built using React.js  and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is developed with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas for secure and scalable data management.
